## 3. Customize your theme
All themes are provided with images & color, but you can easily customize your theme by following these steps

METHOD 1: Editing the theme file

* Step 1: Open the theme file using any text editor, notepad can be hard to read, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) are good options!
* Step 2: Find the ":root" part, this is where all color and images are defined, it may look like this:

* Step 3: Change the values to your liking
   * For images, replace the link, it must be a direct link (www.website.com/exemple-img.png) (you can use .png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif)
   * For colors, replace the color code, you can use this website to get color codes(https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)

METHOD 2: Using Gibbu's theme editor, this tool lets you edit Discord themes without any programming skills required!
